# Introduction
Hello! My name is Tobeerus! I am a hobbyist game dev currently using Gdevelop as a engine!
- I know some knowledge of Renpy (though inexperienced in complicated moments)
- I would love to learn more Python!
- I really like to design games more than code, but I would still like to learn!
